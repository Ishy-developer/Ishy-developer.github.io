           <h2>Here's a time line of Nelson Mandela's life:</h2> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>1918- Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in South Africa, Western Cape Province in the village of Mvezo in Umtata.</li>
  <li>1933- Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland.</li>
  <li>1937- He completed his Junior Certificate in two years, moved to Healdtown, and then moved to Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty</li>
  <li>1939- Mandela began work on a BA degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black institution in Alice, Eastern Cape, with around 150 students</li>
  <li>1940- Mandela found that his father had arranged marriage for him; dismayed, he fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941</li>
  <li>1942 return to Thembuland, where his father died in the winter of 1942. </li>       
  <li>1943-After he passed his BA exams, Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland.
              Mandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student and faced racism.  There, he befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish, and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First. Becoming increasingly politicised, in August 1943 Mandela marched in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises.  Joining the ANC, he was increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending time with other activists at Sisulu's Orlando house, including his old friend Oliver Tambo.</li>
              <li>1944-the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was founded on Easter Sunday 1944 in the Bantu Men's Social Centre, with Lembede as President and Mandela as a member of its executive committee.</li>
              <li>1947- Mandela rushed Lembede, who was ill, to hospital, where he died; he was succeeded as ANCYL president by the more moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary. Mandela was elected to the executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch, serving under regional president C. S. Ramohanoe. When Ramohanoe acted against the wishes of the committee by co-operating with Indians and communists, Mandela was one of those who forced his resignation.</li>
                <li>1948-  South African general election, in which only whites were permitted to vote, the Afrikaner-dominated Herenigde Nasionale Party under Daniel François Malan took power, soon uniting with the Afrikaner Party to form the National Party.  Openly racialist, the party codified and expanded racial segregation with new apartheid legislation.</li>
              <li>1949- Having devoted his time to politics, Mandela failed his final year at Witwatersrand three times; he was ultimately denied his degree.  </li>
              <li>1950- Mandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive</li>
              <li>1952-  Mandela began work at the H.M. Basner law firm, which was owned by a communist, although his increasing commitment to work and activism meant he spent less time with his family.

</li>
              <li>1955- After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg, Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule</li>
              <li>1956- he received his third ban on public appearances, restricting him to Johannesburg for five years, but he often defied it. </li>
              <li>1956- Mandela was arrested alongside most of the ANC national executive, and accused of "high treason" against the state.</li>
              <li>1961- six years after the Treason Trial began, the judges produced a verdict of not guilty, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to convict the accused of "high treason", since they had advocated neither communism nor violent revolution; the outcome embarrassed the government.</li>
              <li>1962-police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick.  In later years, Donald Rickard, a former American diplomat revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency, who feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the South African police of his location.</li>
              <li>Mandela was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission. </li>
              <li>1964- justice De Wet found Mandela and two of his co-accused guilty on all four charges; although the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied, the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment.</li>
              <li>Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years.</li>
              <li> 1980- the slogan "Free Mandela!" was developed by journalist Percy Qoboza, sparking an international campaign that led the UN Security Council to call for his release</li>
                    <li>1982-Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island.</li>
                  <li> 1988- Mandela's 70th birthday attracted international attention, including a tribute concert at London's Wembley Stadium that was televised and watched by an estimated 200 million viewers.</li>
                  <li>1989- F.W de Klerk, new National Party leader called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela.</li>
              <li>1990- Mandela led a multiracial ANC delegation into preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner men. </li>
              <li>1994- the ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and orchestrating People's Forums across the country at which Mandela could appear, as a popular figure with great status among black South Africans. </li>
              <li>1995- he found Neslson Mandela Children's Fund</li>
              <li>1999-  Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu, Retires</li>
              <li>2013- Mandela dies</li>
